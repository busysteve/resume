\section{Summary}
Stephen enjoys solving big problems with simple solutions. His experience speaks for itself as he has taken part in providing many solutions for various needs. His passion for his work is as obvious as the joy he receives from it. He cares about others as he strives to exceed the expectation of his superiors.
\section{Expertise}
With experience as a C/C++ developer stemming from a childhood interest to learn C and 6800/68000 assembly language in the 80s, I have made use of many technologies including C++, Java, SQL, Python, HTML, JavaScript, XML, JSON.  I have strong Object Oriented Design and Development skills in C++ and Java as well as skills in designing and implementing high performance and highly available multi-threaded transaction systems for UNIX and Windows. \\
\\
My industry of focus has been Payment Processing including Prepaid, Debit, Association Routing and EMV, in both the Frontend Authorization and Backend Settlement areas. Cryptography and Network Application Security using well known and custom algorithms are also in my career experience. Database layout and design with many DBMS using SQL, native database APIs and ODBC are common place. I've worked with real-time development of embedded micro-controllers and PC systems with Linux, RT-Linux kernel modifications, and custom operating systems and controller libraries. Experience with business process analysis for streamlining, automation, and data analysis.
